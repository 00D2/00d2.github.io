When a topology (send different responses based on the source address) record is evaluated it will use the source IP of the LDNS server. Usually this is OK for most applications, but it would be ideal to be able to forward more precise information from the LDNS server.</p><p><img src="https://community.f5.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/6994i1672E85A3CA93772" alt=""></p><h4 id="ecs-dns-requests" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ecs-dns-requests" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ECS DNS Requests</h4><p>Using ECS a LDNS server can inject additional meta-data about the request that includes information about the source IP address of the client.
